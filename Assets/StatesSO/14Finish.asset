    Pax may have been a little embarrassed. \n\nNo photos were staged, they were
    all taken when Pax was going about his usual business - cats after all are naturally
    curious.\n\nAnd the yellow rope was indeed his favourite toy.\n\nPax is a pedigree
    cream British Shorthair.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GloMd-69pLcEoDHUWWizyA-ogQaJHuqVIENXo8GgO4I/edit#slide=id.ga0d1327af_0_95\n"
